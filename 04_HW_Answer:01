//This is a simple math operations program take only two numbers.
//data type (double) is used to avoid the possible overflow of (intger) data type is used.
/*The devision operation:
. Double datatype is used to get the fractions if any.
. The if condition checking the the second number (the devisor) if it is 0m it prints the mentioned message and finishes the program
